Boris Bikes
-----------

First day coding in C#. Object Oriented model of the Boris Bikes bicycle system in London.

I am aware of all the repetition going on in the code but for the reason of practice as much as posible to get the basics of the syntax I won't refactor until the project is totally finished. :)

### Objectives

Get the basics of C# syntax and get started with Nunit testing framework using MonoDevelop.

### Classes

I started with the simplest class that is the Bike class and then worked up from there to more complex classes.

### Testing

All the tests are being executed with real objects instead of mocks at the moment.
